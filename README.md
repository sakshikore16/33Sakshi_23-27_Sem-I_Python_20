# Python Programs Repository 🐍

Welcome to my Python programs repository! Below are the Python scripts available in this repository, covering a range of topics from basic algorithms to object-oriented programming.

## Programs

1. [Write a Python program to create a person class. Include attributes like name,
country and date of birth. Implement a method to determine the person's age.](1age_calcii.py) - Calculating age based on birth year.
2. [Write a Python program to create a class representing a stack data structure.
Include methods for pushing and popping elements.](2stack_ds.py) - Implementing a stack data structure.
3. [Write a Python program to create a class representing a shopping cart. Include
methods for adding and removing items, and calculating the total price.](3shopping_cart.py) - Simple shopping cart implementation.
4. [Write a Python program to create a class representing a bank. Include methods for
managing customer accounts and transactions.](4class_bank.py) - Creating classes to model a bank account system.
5. [Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare
charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we
need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for
bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.](5bus_class.py) - Defining a class for managing bus operations.
6. [Define a class attribute “color” with a default value white. i.e., Every Vehicle
should be white.](6vehicle_colour.py) - Adding color attribute to vehicle class.
7. [Implement a class inheritance as following](7inheritance.py) - Understanding inheritance in Python classes.
8. [Create a Python class called “Car” with attributes like make, model, and year.
Then, create an object of the “Car” class and print its details.](8car_class.py) - Building a class to represent a car with specific attributes and methods.
9. [Create a base class called “Animal” and two subclasses, “Dog” and “Cat.” Add
methods and attributes specific to each subclass.](9animal.py) - Implementing classes to model different animals.
10. [Create three classes, “Person,” “Employee,” and “Student.” Use multiple
inheritance to create a class “PersonInfo” that inherits from both “Employee” and
“Student.” Add attributes and methods specific to each class.](10class_person.py) - Implementing a class to represent a person with attributes and methods.
11. [Create a base class called “Vehicle” with a method called “drive.” Implement two
subclasses, “Car” and “Bicycle,” that inherit from “Vehicle” and override the “drive”
method with their own implementations.](11vehicle_method.py) - Defining methods for a vehicle class to perform actions like starting and stopping.
12. [Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible
by 7, between a given range 0 and n.](12divisibleby7.py) - Finding numbers divisible by 7 within a given range.
13. [Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The
output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.](13sort_alphanumeric.py) - Sorting a list of alphanumeric strings.
14. [To find the Euclidean distance between two points in a two dimensional space
using class and object](14euclidean_dist.py) - Calculating the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space.
15. [Create a Python program for an online quiz system. Implement classes for
quizzes, questions, and users. Include methods for taking quizzes, scoring, and
displaying results.](15online_quiz.py) - Implementation of an online quiz program.
16. [Build a hotel reservation system with classes for rooms, guests, and reservations.
Implement methods for checking room availability, booking rooms, and generating
invoices.](16hotel_reserve.py) - Managing hotel room reservations.
17. [Develop a time tracking system for employees with classes for employees,
projects, and time entries. Implement methods for logging hours, generating
timesheets, and calculating overtime.](17tracking_system.py) - Implementing a tracking system to monitor objects.
18. [Create a conference room booking system with classes for rooms, reservations,
and users. Include methods for checking room availability, booking time slots, and
sending notifications.](18conference_booking.py) - Booking system for conference rooms.
19. [Design a recipe management system with classes for recipes, ingredients, and
users. Implement methods for adding recipes, searching by ingredients](19recipe_system.py) - Building a system to manage recipes and ingredients.
20. [Build a simulation of an ATM system with classes for accounts, transactions, and
users. Implement methods for withdrawing cash, checking balances, and handling
PIN verification.](20ATM_system.py) - Simulating an ATM system.
